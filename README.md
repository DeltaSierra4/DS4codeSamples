This repository contains various coding samples by Vincent Yang and serves as a portfolio of my various projects showcasing my expertise in the area of AI/LLM development, Data Science, and other miscellaneous coding work.

# LLM Projects 

The `LLM Projects` directory contains the following LLM and AI projects:

* DiscordSummarizer: An AI-assisted summarizer that connects to the logging functionality of Discord bot YAGPDB.
* PromptEngineering: Sample codes from 2023 that utilizes LangChain and GPT-3.5 to practice with job searching. `sample1.py` asks GPT-3.5 to summarize a candidate's resume and rate their fit based on a job description. `sample2.py` was used to conduct practice interviews using a candidate's resume and job descriptions.
* SevenTrips: An AI-assisted advisor that analyzes an applicants resume and a job posting **for a job that they were rejected for**, then provides advice on how to improve the applicant's resume for a better chance to get accepted in the next job application. It also provides resume revisions from the perspective of an ATS bot. Currently work in progress.
* SillyBattleBot: A silly-fun text-based debate where I make different LLMs engage in a debate against one another.

# Data Science Samples

The `Data Science Samples` directory contains the following data science projects:

* JobScraper: A simple python code from 2022 used to scrape local job boards for relevant job postings.
* SuperHeroAnalysis: A simple python code from 2023 written to analyze and extract meaningful data out of unstructured data related to Superheroes.

# Other Coding Samples

The `Other Coding Samples` directory contains the following coding projects:

* DrMarioSample: An AI-assisted script that serves as a quick demo of a Dr. Mario game. Currently work in progress.
* ReinforcedMachineLearning: A python script that teaches the computer how to play the NIM game.
